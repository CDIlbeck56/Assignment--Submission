# How to Process Half a Hog 

## Summary

This set of instructions is intended for people who are new to the butchering business but have already passed equipment safety training and would like to learn and effective way to process a hog. These instructions break down the steps that take place from the time the hog is hung on the rail (killed and placed on a hook that attached to a rail as means for transporting the carcass) until the hog is cut up and separated into retail cuts to be packaged and sold. In addition to breaking down the steps, the instructions also explain the importance of following the step by step procedure and illustrates what the end product for each step should look like.

## Introduction

### What Does it Mean to Process a Hog and Why is it Important?
Processing a hog is an important trade that a butcher most learn in order to be effective and to make money. The purpose for processing a hog is to produce an end product that satisfies the costumer or consumer's needs. Hogs are processed in a particular order or manner because certain areas of the hog are of higher value to consumers. A consumer may prefer one particular cut of meat over the other; therefore, a butcher must know and understand where that cut of meat comes from and the steps that he must take in order to provide the preferred cut.

### What Tools Are Needed to Process A Hog
A boning knife, bone saw, cutting table (big enough to set half a hog on), and a facility with equipment. An electric saw is optional but not required. Cutting glove and latex gloves are optional but not required.

### Some Basic Knowledge and Terminology
A butcher most understand the four major sections of the hog. These sections include the ham, loin, side (bacon), and shoulder. Before one can understand where particular cuts come form on a hog they must understand which area the cut of meat is coming from on the hog (picture the full hog divided into four sections). Certain parts of a hog are prepared differently once again depending on the consumers preferences. The ham and side are two areas of the hog that require further preperation know as smoking. Smoking is the process of using smoke and heat created from burning wood chunks to heat treat the meat. A ham is usually fully cooked to a temperature of 158 degrees Fahrenheit. The hog side is only heat treated or smoked to around 140 degrees Fahrenheit. Hams are typically broken down and sold as a whole or half ham, ham steak, or a small portion known as the ham hock (the section of the rear leg just right above the bend). The side of the hog is divided into two sections the loin which is the top half and the side which is the bottom half. The major component that make up the top half or loin section are the sirloin, upper rib section, outer loin, and tenderloin. This is the section where the  loin and rib chops are cut form (commonly known as pork chops). The bottom half of the side contains the spare ribs (lower portion of the ribs) and the fresh side or bacon area. The last section is the shoulder. The shoulder is separated out into the Boston butt, picnic, and hock. The Boston butt in top half of the shoulder, the picnic makes up the bottom third of the shoulder, and the hock once again the portion that extends from the knee up (only two to four inches above the knee).

## Step by Step Instructions

The hog is broken down into four major sections. Each major section represents a step in the process. The four sections are ham, loin, side, and shoulder. 

### Step 1: Removing the Ham

Start the process with half a hog lying flat on the table with the feet facing you. Start on the ham or hind quarter of the hog. Take two fingers and place next to the split pelvic bone. A two fingers width is about two inches away from the pelvic bone. Visual a straight line from the outside edge of your finger. The line your visualizing should extend from the hogs back down to the flank or belly. Next take the boning or electric saw and cut straight down that visual line and all the way through the carcass. The ham should now be detached from the remainder of the hog.

### Step 2: Removing the Front Shoulder

Move to the front quarter of the hog known as the shoulder. Find the first rib and count back three ribs. Once again visualize a line in between the third and fourth rib that extends from the top of the hog down into its armpit area. Take the saw of your choice and cut in a straight line in between the third and fourth rib. The shoulder should now be detached and the only thing remaining should be then entire side of the hog.

### Step 3: Split the Side in Half

Look at the end of side where the shoulder of the hog was attached. The big round muscle that runs down the hogs back is referred to as the loin. On the end of the hog that the shoulder is removed from you can see the end of the loin muscle. That loin muscle runs down the entire length of the hogs back and gets thicker the closer it gets to the ham. When splitting the side into two halves the outer edge of the loin muscle serves as guide for splitting the hog side into an upper and lower portion. Take the saw and cut a approximately half and inch from the outer loin muscle down the entire length of the hog (remember that the loin muscle gets thicker as you near the rear portion of the hog where the ham was removed). The only bones being cut are rib bones. Once you have sawed through all the rib bones there should be a top section referred to as the loin and a bottom section referred to as the side (both contain ribs, but the top section is easily recognizable because of the spine).
